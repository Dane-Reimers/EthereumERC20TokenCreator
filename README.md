# EthereumERC20TokenCreator

The Ethereum ERC20 Token Creator is a smart contract that allows users to create there own ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. Code for the ERC20 tokens was taken from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20

## Usage
The smart contract was deployed to the Ethereum network at address "0xFF298f6EbFAC559de29C1Cb5F37fc507bdE7864C", users can access and interact with the contract via Etherscan here https://etherscan.io/address/0xff298f6ebfac559de29c1cb5f37fc507bde7864c. To create a new ERC20 token, navigate to the link, click "contract", then "write contract", then enter the parameters for your new token and click write. Note, to actually write to the Ethereum network you will have to have a Ethereum wallet connect to Etherscan with Metamask.
